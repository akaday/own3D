# Getting Started

## Introduction

Alerts are an essential part of engaging with your viewers while streaming. They notify you and your viewers when
someone follows you, subscribes to you, donates, and more. OWN3D Pro offers customizable alert sets that allow you to
personalize your alerts with images, sounds, fonts, and animations. This guide will help you understand the terminology
and provide examples to get you started with setting up alerts.

## Terminology

Before diving into the alert configuration, let's familiarize ourselves with some key terms:

### Alert Set

An alert set is a collection of different alerts displayed together within a single browser source in broadcasting
software like OBS Studio. It helps you organize your alerts with different themes or branding.

### Alert Set Configuration

An alert set configuration defines the settings for how an alert is displayed. It consists of a `default` template and a
list of `variations` with specific overrides.

### Alert Type

An alert type refers to the specific category or purpose of an alert. It defines the action or event that triggers the
alert. Examples of alert types include `follow`, `subscribe`, `donation`, `cheer`, `raid`, and `shoutout`. Each alert
type can have its own variations and conditions to determine how the alert should be displayed. Alert types are
associated with specific platforms such as Twitch, YouTube, TikTok, and Kick.

### Alert Variation

An alert variation is a specific configuration that defines how an alert should appear for a particular scenario. Each
variation has its own set of `conditions` and `overrides`.

### Alert Variation Conditions

Conditions are used to determine which variation should be used for a given alert. They are defined using logical
operators and compare variables to specific values.

### Message Template Parameters

::: v-pre
Message templates allow you to customize the text displayed in alerts. Parameters are placeholders in the template that
get replaced with actual values during rendering. For example, `{{ name }}` could be replaced with the name of the person
who triggered the alert.
:::

You can find more about message template parameters in the [Message Template Parameters](./template-parameters.md) guide.

## Alert Set Configuration Example <Badge text="AE4" type="success"/>

Here's an example of an alert set configuration in JSON format:

```json
{
  "id": 490885,
  "user_id": 1,
  "active": true,
  "default": {
    "title": null,
    "subtitle": null,
    "font_family": "Montserrat",
    "font_color": "#ffffff",
    ...
  },
  "variations": [
    {
      "name": "Twitch Cheer",
      "conditions": {
        "and": [
          {"===": [{"var": "type"}, "twitch-cheer"]},
          {"===": [{"var": "enabled"}, true]},
          {">=": [{"var": "amount"}, 1000]}
        ]
      },
      "overrides": {
        "title": "Thanks {{name}} for cheering over 1K bits!ðŸ’ƒðŸ’ƒðŸ’ƒ"
      }
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

In this example, we have an alert set configuration with an `id`, `user_id`, and `active` status. The `default` template
defines the default settings for alerts. The `variations` list contains different variations of alerts with their
conditions and overrides.

## Example of Existing Types in Alerts Engine 4 <Badge text="AE4" type="success"/>

::: warning
In **Alerts Engine 4 (AE4)** we changed the naming of alert types. We added the platform name from the alert type. For
example, `follow` will become `twitch-follow`. This is to make it easier to customize alerts for different platforms.

You can migrate your existing alert sets to AE4 by using the [AE3 Migration API](#ae3-migration-api).
:::

::: tip
**Technical Terms Recommendations:** We kept the same wording for alerts with the same intend. Follow (Twitch),
Subscribe (YouTube) and Follow (Kick) will become `-follow`. Also for Subscribe (Twitch), Member (YouTube) and
Subscribe (Kick) will become `-subscribe`.

## AE3 Migration API <Badge text="in development" type="error"/>

The AE3 Migration API allows you to migrate your existing alert sets to AE4. It is a REST API that takes an AE3 alert
set as input and migrates it to AE4.

```http request
POST https://api.own3d.pro/v1/alert-configs/{id}/migrate
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer <token>

{
 "engine": "ae4"
}

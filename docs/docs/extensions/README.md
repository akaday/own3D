## What is an extension? <Badge text="closed beta" type="warning"/>

Extensions are hosted html, css and javascript files, small applications, which are hosted by our content delivery network. 
They allow streamers to add functionality to their OWN3D Pro dashboard and OBS Studio installation.
The backend must be hosted by the extension author themselves.

## Create your first extension <Badge text="closed beta" type="warning"/>

Since custom extensions are still in the closed beta, you need to request access through our [extension request form](https://own3d.gg/extension-request). 
After you getting access to the closed beta, you can start creating your own extensions.

### Step 1: Checkout our example extension

Clone our example extension from [GitHub](https://github.com/own3d/extension-boilerplate) and start editing the files.

The entrypoint of the extension is the `index.html` file.

### Step 2: Upload it to our CDN

If you're done with the extension, you can upload it to our CDN.

### Step 3: Review and publish it

After publishing your extension, you can use it in your OWN3D Pro dashboard. There you can test all the features of your extension. 
If you want to publish your extension to the public, you need to submit your extension for a code and feature review.

## FAQ

### When does the bot enter my chat?

The EventSub-based chatbot is configured to stay in your chat whenever you log into OWN3D Pro. Unless you disconnect from OWN3D Pro in Twitch.

### Does the chatbot have an API?

Yes, but it is currently not documented and is not officially supported. But in theory you as a developer can manage the chatbot via REST API.

## Why our Chatbot need's a Moderator Role

Our chatbot offers you features such as removing messages. For example, after executing a command or removing spam. The moderator role allows our bot to remove these messages and keep your chat clean.

## Giving our Chatbot a Moderator Role

To give our bot rights, just go to your Twitch Dashboard under [Settings > Roles](https://www.twitch.tv/dashboard/roles). There you will find the role management of your channel. In this area you can give our bot "OWN3D" the role "Moderator". This gives the bot all necessary rights.

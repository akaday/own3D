# Getting Started

## What is a widget?

Widgets are hosted html, css and javascript files, small applications, which are hosted by our content delivery network. 
They allow streamers to add functionality to their OWN3D Pro dashboard and OBS Studio installation.
The backend must be hosted by the widget author themselves.

## Create your first widget

Since custom widgets are still in the closed beta, you need to request access through our [widget request form](https://own3d.gg/widget-request). 
After you getting access to the closed beta, you can start creating your own widgets.

### Step 1: Checkout our example widget

Clone our example widget from [github](#) and start editing the files.

The entrypoint of the widget is the `index.html` file.

### Step 2: Upload it to our CDN

If you're done with the widget, you can upload it to our CDN.

### Step 3: Review and publish it

After publishing your widget, you can use it in your OWN3D Pro dashboard. There you can test all the features of your widget. 
If you want to publish your widget to the public, you need to submit your widget for a code and feature review.

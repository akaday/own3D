## What is DDEX?

DDEX is a standards setting organisation focused on the creation of digital value chain standards to make the exchange of data and information across the music industry more efficient.

## FTP Accounts

OWN3D supports the DDEX format and allows uploads through the FTP protocol. 
Credentials can be requested through your OWN3D Partner Manager.

Server: `ddex.partners.jukebox.gg`

## FTP Folder Structure

A complete upload includes one `batch folder` and several `package folders`.  
A `batch` is a collection of `packages` arranged into a particular directory structure.  
The `batch folder` consists of a date and a serial number.  
A `package` is a folder containing all these assets and the metadata for each album.

## File Formats

Album Cover files can be uploaded in `.jpg` formats and must be at least `500Ã—500 pixels`.  
Audio files can be uploaded in `.wav` or `.flac`, lossless formats.  
XML metadata files should be `UTF-8` encoded.  
We follow the ERN (Electronic Release Notification) standard, for versions `3.8.2` and `4.1`.

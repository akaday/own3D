# Information about Self-XSS attack

In order to protect our users from Self-XSS attacks, we have implemented a feature that will show a warning message when
you open the developer console. **If you see this message, please do not copy and paste anything into your browser's
developer console.**

## What is Self-XSS attack?

Self-XSS is a social engineering attack used to gain control of victims' web accounts by tricking users into copying and
pasting malicious content into their browsers. Usually, the attacker will use a fake social media message or email to trick
the victim into copying and pasting malicious content into their browser's developer console.

## How to protect yourself from Self-XSS attack?

The best way to protect yourself from Self-XSS attacks is to never copy and paste anything into your browser's developer
console. If you are asked to do so, it is most likely a Self-XSS attack. If you are unsure, please contact our support
team.

## I'm a developer. Can I still use the developer console?

Yes, you can still use the developer console. However, you should only use it if you know what you are doing. Since the
developer console is a powerful tool, it can be used to do malicious things to your browser.
